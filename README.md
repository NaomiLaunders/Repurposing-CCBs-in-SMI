# Psychiatric symptom improvement from adjunctive antihypertensive prescribing in severe mental illness: three target trial emulation studies

This repo is currently under development and therefore private!

Code will be uploaded in chunks from R Studio for version control. Chunks will generally be: Code lists (scripts beginning 1), observations (scripts beginning 2), cohort creation (scripts beginning 3) and analysis (scripts beginning 4).

This project uses pseudonymised patient records and so no data is available for uploading.

Many of the code lists used in the study are already available in the statins repo: (https://github.com/NaomiLaunders/Repurposing-statins-in-SMI)
