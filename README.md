# Psychiatric symptom improvement from adjunctive antihypertensive prescribing in severe mental illness: three target trial emulation studies

This repo is currently under development and therefore private!

Code will be uploaded in chunks from R Studio for version control. Chunks will be: Code lists (scripts beginning 1), observations (scripts beginning 2), cohort creation (scripts beginning 3) and analysis (scripts beginning 4).

## Understanding the files

Scripts are organised into chunks: Code lists (scripts beginning 1), observations (scripts beginning 2), cohort creation (scripts beginning 3) and analysis (scripts beginning 4).

Code lists were generated in CPRD. They are specific to CPRD and to the exact database builds. When re-using codelists it's advisable to search for new terms in the system being used.

CPRD code lists use medcodes. These long numeric identifiers must be kept as character vectors in R, Stata and Excel to avoid truncation.

This project uses pseudonymised patient records and so no data is available for uploading.

Many of the code lists used in the study are already available in the statins repo: (https://github.com/NaomiLaunders/Repurposing-statins-in-SMI)
